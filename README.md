1. Developed a Weather App using Android technologies such as Retrofit for API integration, Hilt for dependency injection, View- Model for managing UI-related data, RoomDatabase for local data storage, and Jetpack Compose for building the user interface.
2. The app allows users to fetch real-time weather data and store it locally for offline access. Implemented features include display- ing current weather, hourly and daily forecasts, and location-based weather updates.
3. Technologies: Retrofit, Hilt, ViewModel, RoomDatabase, Jetpack Compose-Kotlin

<!-- ## Improvements :
1. If someone put wrong login details, app was crashing :  Fixed
2. Due to TypeMismatch , app was crashing. like Int or Double : Fixed
3. Data or Classed made by "Json to Kotlin class" plugin was not very accurate, due to which app was crashing. I choose better class/data class structure so that app does not crash : Fixed
4. Proper use of Firebase database as if it is realtime database : Fixed
5. If login credentails are wrong, then show a Toast message to indicate that so. : Fixed
6. If during Create Account, wrong details were entered, then show warning. : Not Fixed
7. Bring data of perticular user only. In app, whole data was brought ,then according to user, data was filtered, this may lead to security issues : Not Fixed -->
